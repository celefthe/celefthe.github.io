Around the Christmas of 2021, towards the tail-end of what would've been nearly two years of the Covid-19 pandemic, I came across [this blog post by Austin Henley](https://austinhenley.com/blog/lessonsfrommyphd.html), which ended up being one of the most influential bits of writing I read during my PhD. If you're reading this and haven't already done so, I very much encourage you to go back and read his post. Austin's blog really struck a chord with me; his insights about navigating supervisor meetings, presentations and keeping motivated really resonated with my experience at the time, and it really helped me put things into perspective and reframe my approach to my PhD.

About two years ago and roughly 4.5 years after I first joined [Ian Duguid's](https://duguidlab.com) lab as a PhD student, I graduated. With a tap on the head by the [medieval space bonnet](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/harry-potter-sorting-hat-geneva-bonnet-graduation), it was over.

By and large, I think I was pretty lucky with my PhD. I had an incredible supervisor, awesome colleagues, and a super interesting project that I was able to make my own. Most of my challenges came mainly from the fact that doing a PhD is _hard_. The science is hard, the experiments are hard, the analysis is hard, the writing is hard. The whole thing is just not easy at all.

Also there was a global pandemic going on, which didn't help.

As I look back at my time as a PhD student, I think that most of what I've actually _learned_ really had nothing to do with neuroscience per se. I mean, learning about the brain and neurodevelopmental disorders was a big chunk of it, sure. But it ain't all there is to it.

Here I list a few of the things that I learned during my time as a PhD student in the hope that you'll find them useful, whether you're just starting out on your PhD or are well into it. Of course, these are all relevant to what _my_ PhD was like, so take it all with a bucket of salt; your mileage may vary.

### Take ownership

It sounds fairly obvious, but your PhD project is _your_ PhD project.

The harsh reality is that nobody is going to care about your project as much as you do. Your supervisor is likely managing multiple projects, your colleagues have their own work, your friends and family have their own lives and at best only _sort of_ understand what you're doing. All these people probably care about you as a person and have vested interests in your success. But they ain't the ones that have to do the doing. This is going to be on you.

What this means is that you're going to have to be the driving force behind the project, not just practically (i.e. doing the experiments) but also intellectually. While your supervisor will more than likely give you a place to start from, the direction of the project is going to largely be down to you. Your supervisor is there to provide guidance and support, but it's up to you to you understand what it is that you're doing and why.

This is what really sets the PhD apart from any other degree. Nobody's there to tell you _what_ you need to do - and quite frankly you [really don't want them to](https://austinhenley.com/blog/lessonsfrommyphd.html#leadorbeled).

When you're only just starting out, this is going to be very intimidating indeed, especially if you aren't coming into your PhD with a whole lot of experience in the field. I found the first year of my PhD to be the most difficult just because of how overwhelming it all was. It can be hard to know what's expected of you, and whether what you're doing is enough and even whether all this is really _for_ you. Taking ownership of your project at a time where the only thing you're sure of is that you have no idea what you're doing is going to be a big challenge.

Here's a few things I found helpful:

- It's natural to be worried about sounding silly in front of your supervisor or your colleagues, but you'll have to beat this pretty quickly and ask as many questions as you possibly can. Nobody's expecting you to know everything (or, really, anything) from the get-go, so whenever you come across something you're not sure about, ask. This is especially true for lab meetings or journal clubs; there will be lots of things you don't know but you're surrounded by experts, so just ask them! Sitting in a corner silent and confused is only going to be detrimental to your learning. Get over yourself and sound dumb, it's good for you.
- The trick to having good ideas is to have lots of them. Most are going to be terrible. Some might not be. Your supervisor can act as a great sounding board for which ideas are probably worth exploring and can translate into work that'll fit the time (and budget) constrains of your PhD.
- If you think an idea is good, stand by it. Sometimes a good idea is going to get shot down, but that doesn't mean you ought to abandon it. Take the feedback, refine your reasoning, and try again.
- Likewise, if you've been suggested to do something that you don't think is a good idea, don't act like you can't question it just because it came from someone more senior. Again, it's your project, and you're spending much more time thinking about it than anybody else. This doesn't mean you should ignore advice and never listen to anybody else but sometimes you'll just have to weigh things up and arrive at your own conclusions.
- If you're not sure how you're doing - ask! Have a chat with your supervisor and ask them how they think you're doing. Remember your success is in your supervisor's best interest, and you taking ownership of your project is a crucial aspect of becoming an independent scientist - so they'll want to help[^1].

Scary as it might be, taking ownership of your project is honestly one of the most rewarding aspects of a PhD. Take the plunge and it'll pay off!

### Plan, plan, plan

You know the old adage "if you fail to plan, you plan to fail"? You're going to have to take it pretty seriously because a PhD is _not_ a whole lot of time[^2], especially if experiments are involved. Everything is going to take a lot longer than you'd expect, and going at it without a plan at all is a recipe for a whole lot of anxiety and disappointment.

That doesn't mean your planning has to be _perfect_. For the most part, it just has to _be_. Planning forces you to confront the practical realities of whatever experiment or research direction you and your supervisor have come up with. Coming up with experiments (or analysis) is easy. Actually doing them is a whole other kettle of fish. Coming out of a "jam session" with your supervisor with half a dozen ideas for stuff to do and attempting to do all of them them all at once is a recipe for [burning out](https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases). You're not immune to this. A PhD is not a whole lot of time, but it's not a short amount of time either. Firing all cylinders at all times, working >60 hour weeks for years on end, is unrealistic and unsustainable. Ideally, with a bit of planning you can spread the workload a little more evenly and keep a somewhat consistent output. And, when inevitably you _do_ need to push, you can at least have some idea of how long you have to push _for_.

Unlike something like software engineering where it is conceivable to have a pretty good idea of what the final product will look like _a priori_, the reality of research is that direction is bound to change frequently and (at times) rather suddenly depending on how experiments go. This is going to be particularly true at the start, when the overall question / hypothesis of your project is bound to be somewhat vague. That's perfectly fine. At any one time, you can only really plan based on the information you have available. Treat any plan as ephemeral. Aim to review and revise often.

Project management is an infinite internet rabbit hole. There is an incredible amount of resources and opinions about how to best plan a project or manage your time out there, but I personally find a lot of it quite useless. Most of it appears to cater to a sense of _feeling_ productive without necessarily _being_ productive. But you should explore around and come to your own conclusions; different things work for different people. A few concepts I personally find useful:

- **The five year plan.** I'm not saying that you should be running your PhD project like a [Soviet factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_of_the_Soviet_Union), but I'm not saying you shouldn't be either. The idea here is that project planning should be done at different levels - across your PhD (4/5 years), the upcoming year, the next few months, the next week and, finally, the day ahead of you[^3]. These different planning levels have different scopes; what you would like to achieve across your PhD is going to be different in magnitude than what you want to achieve by the time you go home today. Planning for longer than what's immediately in front of you helps to keep what you're doing in perspective, and also keeps you from losing the forest for the trees. It's a great way to get rid of tasks / experiments that don't directly feed into the bigger picture, particularly when you have a lot on your plate.
- **Milestones.** Coming up with milestones during any long project is a good idea not just to keep things focused, but also to keep motivated and get a sense of accomplishment. It also forces you to come up with concrete _deliverables_ when it comes to a particular body of work, be it analysis or a set of experiments. _I've done X and managed to answer Y_ is a pretty good feeling.
- **Planning backwards.** Once you've identified a milestone, when it comes to the actual scheduling of things I find it's better to start at the end - what the final _thing_ looks like - and work backwards from there. This will force you to think through the interim steps you need to achieve a particular goal, which would otherwise crop up unexpectedly.
- **Time blocking.** As simple as it sounds, I find this to be extremely effective (when I actually manage to pull it off, which in all fairness is not that often). Block time in your calendar to do _one thing, and do it well_. Do nothing else during that time. Keeps the mind focused so you don't have to constantly context switch, which is both tiring and counter-productive. Also a great way to plan the week ahead so that you don't have to think about what it is you're supposed to be doing every morning and make sure you're spending enough time doing things you actually need[^4] to do.

Vitae, the UK non-profit supporting career development for researchers, has some excellent [resources on planning your PhD project](https://www.vitae.ac.uk/doing-research/doing-a-doctorate/starting-a-doctorate/planning-your-research-project), including lots of practical advice on how to get started.

### Every meeting needs an agenda

Walking into any meeting without a sense of purpose is inevitably going to be a massive waste of your time. Supervisor meetings, meetings with your colleagues, lab meetings, team meetings - if you're there, you need to get something out of them, otherwise you're wasting your time. Particularly for one-on-one meetings, I got a more lot out of them once I started formalising why I was there to begin with. Getting into the habit of jotting a few bullet-points down just prior - for things to discuss, ask or get feedback on - doubles as a great way to keep meetings focused and prevent conversations from going off the rails.

Supervisor meetings in particular become infinitely more useful once you realise they're not for you to justify your existence[^5]. They are there for you to get feedback on your work. Going over a laundry list of every single task you've done since the last meeting is only helpful if your aim is to sound busy. Having a preconception for what _you'll_ find most useful out of a meeting will ensure it becomes time well spent, and also makes it feel somewhat less intimidating.

## Let failure wash over you

Get used to being wrong.

### Details matter

Obsess with detail

Presenting detail is a different matter. Details will always matter more to you than to anyone else

### Bite more than you can chew

If you're feeling comfortable you're probably not learning a whole lot

### Keep a research journal

Notebooks of the mind

### Show up

### Don't panic too much

Not every PhD is the same. There's a very solid chance that your experience was or will be quite different from mine. But I genuinely hope that you'll find at least some of this useful. If you're just starting up your PhD, or are well into it, and are finding it difficult - that's completely normal. Anyone who tells you they found it easy is lying and you should tell them to go away.

You got this.

[^1]: I'm assuming your supervisor will earnestly want to be helpful because this was my experience, but unfortunately this isn't always going to be the case. Not all supervisors are good mentors. There's a few ways you can sort of gauge this before starting a PhD but that's a matter for a different post.
[^2]: The usual PhD funding in the UK for a neuroscience PhD programme is ~4 years.
[^3]: I remember coming across this concept a while back described as planning at "10k ft, 1k ft, 100 ft" etc but I could not find a good resource when writing this post for the life of me. It's practically the same thing.
[^4]: "Need" can take a variety of definitions, but generally speaking - you _need_ food and water, you don't _need_ to spend half a morning trying to work out why the Zotero plugin doesn't work on Safari anymore.
[^5]: If you're in a meeting where you need to justify your existence, you generally _know_ before you rock up to the meeting.
