I received a BSc in Neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh in 2018, where I did my bachelor's dissertation in Dr Cyril Pernet's lab investigating language processing in stroke patients with Wernicke's aphasia.

In 2018, I joined the Duguid Lab as a PhD student to study visuomotor learning deficits in mouse models of Rett syndrome. My PhD was funded by a joint studentship from the Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain and the University of Edinburgh's Principal's Career Development Scholarship. I graduated in 2023; my thesis titled "Visuomotor learning in Rett syndrome" won that year's [Alison Douglas Prize for best PhD thesis in the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences](https://discovery-brain-sciences.ed.ac.uk/constantinos-eleftheriou-wins-years-alison-douglas-prize-best-phd-thesis).

My current research aims to understand the nature of visuomotor learning deficits in Rett Syndrome, a devastating neurodevelopmental disordered caused by mutations in the _Mecp2_ gene. I use behavioural assays in tandem with mesoscale calcium imaging of the dorsal cortex to investigate the evolution of interareal neural dynamics across learning and their breakdown in Rett Syndrome.

I am also interested in software sustainability and the management of large datasets in research, leveraging my past experience in systems administration and software development.
