subtitle: I'm a postdoctoral research fellow in <a href='https://www.duguidlab.com'>Prof Ian Duguid</a>'s group at the <a href='https://www.sidb.org.uk'>Simons Intitiative for the Developing Brain</a>, <a href='https://www.ed.ac.uk'>University of Edinburgh</a>. I'm interested in the neural mechanisms of learning, how they break down in neurodevelopmental disorders and whether higher cognitive processes are amendable to therapeutic intervention.

I received a BSc in Neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh in 2018 with First Class honours. My undergraduate research project was supervised by [Dr Cyril Pernet](https://cpernet.github.io/index.html) at the [Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences), where I investigated language processing in stroke patients with Wernicke's aphasia using fMRI and computational modelling.

In 2018, I joined the Duguid Lab as a PhD student to study visuomotor learning deficits in a mouse model of Rett syndrome, a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the _Mecp2_ gene. Using behavioural assays in tandem with calcium imaging of the dorsal cortex, I established that associative learning deficits precede loss of motor control in mouse models of Rett Syndrome, driven by specific circuit dysfunction in higher-order decision-making cortical areas. My PhD was funded by a joint studentship from the Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain and the University of Edinburgh Principal's Career Development Scholarship. I graduated in 2023; my thesis titled "Visuomotor learning in Rett syndrome" won that year's [Alison Douglas Prize for best PhD thesis in the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences](https://discovery-brain-sciences.ed.ac.uk/constantinos-eleftheriou-wins-years-alison-douglas-prize-best-phd-thesis).

My current research aims to establish whether associative learning deficits in Rett Syndrome are amendable to gene therapy. This work is done in close collaboration with [Prof Stuart Cobb](http://www.cobblab.science) and is funded by the Medical Research Council and the Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain.

I am also interested in software sustainability and the management of large datasets in research, leveraging my past experience in systems administration and software development. Since 2025, I co-lead the SIDB Data Engineering Core facility, which provides research software and data management services to the SIDB community.
