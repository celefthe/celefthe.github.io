    - title: Programming languages.
      items:
        - <b>Python</b>. I have been using Python in a professional capacity since 2013 for software engineering, data analysis and systems administration / DevOps projects. I am fluent in the language and have a delivered a variety of applications and data analysis projects over the past decade, both as part of a team and as a solo developer.
        - <b>JavaScript</b>. I have been using JavaScript since 2016 for building web application front-ends (initially for customer-facing web apps at UoE IS and later for <a href="https://github.com/DuguidLab/visiomode">Visiomode</a>) as well as for interactive data visualisations during my PhD and postdoc.
        - <b>C</b>. I originally picked up C in 2016 during my time as a Unix Systems Administrator for writing and maintaining small Unix tools. My main use of C since has mainly been to speed up Python data processing where appropriate (mainly via Cython).
        - <b>Bash</b>. I have been using Bash in a professional capacity since 2016, mainly for short scripting tasks on Unix and Linux platforms.
        - <b>C++</b>. Since 2018, my experience with C++ has been exclusive to the Arduino platform for writing microcontroller software targetting Arduino and Teensy microcontrollers. Applications include actuators for behavioural tasks (e.g. lever & reward mechanisms), acquisition software for <i>in vivo</i> optical microscopy (single-photon mesoscopy) and software for integrating optical imaging and manipulation <i>in vivo</i>.
        - <b>MATLAB</b>. I have used MATLAB for the analysis of fMRI data during <a href="https://github.com/celefthe/E11928_language_processing_aphasia/tree/master">my project with Dr Cyril Pernet (2017-2018)</a>, mainly using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) package.
        - <b>R</b>. Between 2019 and 2022, I assisted in the delivery of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in biomedical statistics as a tutor, which included hands-on practical exercises and assessments in R.
        - <b>C#</b>. In 2012, I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/celefthe/sldb">patient management application</a> for the polysomnography department of the Paphos General Hospital in Cyprus using C#.NET, WPF and Microsoft SQL.
